                        <p>Worked as a iOS developer linked to the Outage Clearance team to design and develop iOS applications that collected analytical data from IOT devices leveraging proprietary GE Bluetooth technology as well as MQTT systems to collect data from industrial technology in a secure fashion. These new systems provided cost savings to the company by being more accurate than prior tools, portable enough to saving intensive shipping costs, providing better predictive analysis of future tool maintenance, and run applications dependably and quickly enough to significantly cut the labor costs of field engineers. Applications required a working knowledge of Objective-C, AngularJS 1.0 and 2.0, Ionic 1 and 2, javascript, Cordova, iOS design principles, data structures, database programming, Predix, and other methods pertaining to RESTful services. Provided support throughout the entire software cycle, worked independently and as a team, as well as provided occasional mentorship for software interns. Also assisted in testing and implementing a NodeJS environment in order to test code that was later added to a Node server that was established on an IOT device.
